## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Do I need to implement all tasks?
**A**: No. Focus on CRITICAL tasks first. HIGH and MEDIUM are optional but improve competitiveness.

### Q: Can I modify the suggested implementation?
**A**: Yes! These are detailed guides, not strict requirements. Adapt to your style while meeting acceptance criteria.

### Q: What if I'm running out of time?
**A**: Prioritize:
1. Task 005 (Multimodal) - Biggest differentiator
2. Task 001 (Translator) - Required API
3. Task 006 (Video) - Required deliverable
4. Task 007 (README) - Required deliverable
5. Task 000 (Checklist) - Verify submission

### Q: Should I complete Task 006 (video) last?
**A**: Record early footage, but edit last. This ensures you showcase actual features, not mockups.

### Q: How do I know when a task is complete?
**A**: Check the "Success Metrics" section in each task file. All criteria should be met.

### Q: Can I work on multiple tasks in parallel?
**A**: Yes, if they don't conflict. For example:
- OK: Tasks 001 + 002 (different APIs)
- NOT OK: Task 006 + 007 at same time (video needs features finished first)
